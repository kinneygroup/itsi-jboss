### Services
JBoss monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of server performance:

1. Application Server
    * Description: The main JBoss application server responsible for running and managing deployed applications.
2. JVM
    * Description: Manages the Java Virtual Machine, which runs the JBoss server.
3. Web Container
    * Description: Handles HTTP requests and manages web applications.
4. EJB
    * Description: Manages Enterprise JavaBeans for business logic execution.
5. Datasource
    * Description: Manages database connections and connection pools.
6. Cache
    * Description: Manages caching mechanisms to improve performance.
7. Transaction Management
    * Description: Manages database transactions.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Heap Memory Usage
    * Description: Monitor used vs. max heap memory.
2. Thread Count
    * Description: Number of active threads.
3. GC Events
    * Description: Frequency and duration of garbage collection events.
4. JVM Uptime
    * Description: Track the uptime of the JVM.
5. Request Count
    * Description: Number of HTTP requests received.
6. Request Processing Time
    * Description: Time taken to process HTTP requests.
7. HTTP Session Count
    * Description: Number of active HTTP sessions.
8. Invocation Count
    * Description: Number of EJB method invocations.
9. Invocation Time
    * Description: Time taken for EJB method invocations.
10. Pool Size
    * Description: Size of the EJB pool.
11. Connection Pool Usage
    * Description: Number of active vs. available connections.
12. Connection Pool Wait Time
    * Description: Time spent waiting for a connection.
13. Connection Pool Leaks
    * Description: Number of leaked connections.
14. Cache Hit Rate
    * Description: Ratio of cache hits to total cache accesses.
15. Cache Miss Rate
    * Description: Ratio of cache misses to total cache accesses.
16. Cache Evictions
    * Description: Number of items evicted from the cache.
17. Transaction Count
    * Description: Number of transactions processed.
18. Transaction Rollbacks
    * Description: Number of transactions rolled back.
19. Transaction Commit Time
    * Description: Time taken to commit transactions.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies: 
Services are interconnected; for instance, the Application Server is dependent on the JVM, Web Container, EJB, Datasource, and Cache services. Similarly, the JVM relies on Garbage Collection and Thread Management for optimal performance.

#### Hierarchical Structure: 
Some services form a hierarchy, such as the Web Container depending on Access Logs and Session Management, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
